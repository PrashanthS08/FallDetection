# FallDetection
My Academic Mini-Project

Developed a fall detection algorithm based on computer vision techniques which detect falls accurately and promptly in video
 footage and provides visual feedback by marking fall events on the video frames and also includes an alarm system
 to alert caregivers or monitoring personnel about detected falls through email.
